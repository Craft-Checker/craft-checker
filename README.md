# craft-checker

*Overview:
This is an app (in-progress) that will provide a sort of virtual crafting table similar to the one in the game, Minecraft.

It is meant to simulate crafting on the pc version of the game. This is meant to practice crafting the receipts of items. Instead of actually crafting items, when the user drags and drops items onto the table an item will appear in the result box if the pattern of items is a receipt that matches any craft-able items. Also, dragging an item into the result box will automatically update the crafting table with the correct items and layout of the receipt that corresponds to that item provided that it is an item capable of being crafted.

*Overall Goal:
This app is meant to be a guide for a user to quickly look up how to craft an item. It is also meant to be a sort of practice crafting table just in case a user wants to practice trying to remember the crafting receipts.

Functionality to be implemented:
    -Drag and drop items
    -A sub-menu to scroll through items (Organized by categories)
    -Toast message that pops up describing the item when clicked on (optional)

*Possible Future Additions:
    -Add a home page (home button too?)
    -Make other types of crafting guide functionality similar to the crafting table
        -Furnace smelting guide
        -Potion brewing guide
    -Add sections with general guide in the form of text and pictures
        -Redstone guide
        -Villagers
        -Building ideas
        -Etc...
    -An Exit button to close app without having to manually exit
